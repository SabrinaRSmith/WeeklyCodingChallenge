Java:

Given an object containing counts of both upvotes and downvotes, return what vote count should be displayed. This is calculated by subtracting the number of downvotes from upvotes.

 

Examples

getVoteCount({ upvotes: 13, downvotes: 0 }) ➞ 13

getVoteCount({ upvotes: 2, downvotes: 33 }) ➞ -31

getVoteCount({ upvotes: 132, downvotes: 132 }) ➞ 0

 

Notes

You can expect only positive integers for vote counts.


public static int getVoteCount(ObjectPost p){
	return p.upvotes - p.downvotes;
}
 

C#:

Create a function that takes voltage and current and returns the calculated power.

 

Examples

CircuitPower(230, 10) ➞ 2300

CircuitPower(110, 3) ➞ 330

CircuitPower(480, 20) ➞ 9600

 

Notes

power = voltage * current


static int CircuitPower(int voltage, int current){
	return voltage * current;
}
 

JavaScript:

Create a function that takes the age in years and returns the age in days.

 

Examples

calcAge(65) ➞ 23725

calcAge(0) ➞ 0

calcAge(20) ➞ 7300

 

Notes


	
Use 365 days as the length of a year for this challenge.
	
Ignore leap years and days between last birthday and now.
	
Expect only positive integer inputs.


function calcAge(years){
	return years * 365;
}
 

Python:

Write a function that takes the base and height of a triangle and return its area.

 

Examples

tri_area(3, 2) ➞ 3

tri_area(7, 4) ➞ 14

tri_area(10, 10) ➞ 50

 

Notes


	
The area of a triangle is: (base * height) / 2
	
Don't forget to return the result.



def tri_area(base, height):
	returb base * height / 2
